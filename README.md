# 📊 Sales Analysis – E-commerce Dashboard

This project presents a detailed **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** of e-commerce sales data using Python. It uncovers key insights and performance trends that help stakeholders make data-driven decisions. Visualizations were built using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to support storytelling with data.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The objective of this project is to explore and analyze sales data from a retail store (Superstore dataset) and visualize key metrics. This helps uncover:

- Performance patterns across product categories and regions
- Profitability insights
- Customer segmentation and behavior
- Sales and discount impact on profit

The final dashboard and plots were designed to communicate the most important business insights effectively.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Python** (Jupyter Notebook)
- **Pandas** – For data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib** – For plotting and charting
- **Seaborn** – For enhanced data visualization
- **Excel** – Source data file: `superstore_sales.xlsx`

---

## 📁 Files Included

- `sales_analysis.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with full EDA and visualizations
- `superstore_sales.xlsx` – Cleaned sales data used for analysis
- `README.md` – Project documentation

---

## 📈 Key Metrics & Visualizations

The notebook focuses on exploring and visualizing the following KPIs:

- **Total Sales & Profit**
- **Sales by Region, Category, and Sub-Category**
- **Top Performing Products**
- **Profitability Trends by Discount Levels**
- **Customer Segments Analysis**
- **Shipping Mode Impact**

### 📊 Visualization Types:

- Bar Charts – Category/Sub-category comparisons
- Line Graphs – Time series analysis
- Pie Charts – Customer segment distribution
- Heatmaps – Correlation between variables

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- 📌 **High Discounts Don't Always Lead to Higher Profits** – Deep discounts in certain sub-categories caused profit loss.
- 🛒 **Office Supplies had highest sales** but relatively lower profit margins compared to Technology.
- 🚚 **Standard Class shipping** was the most used, but Second Class often correlated with better profit margins.
- 🌎 **Western and Eastern regions** showed stronger sales and profits than Central or Southern areas.
